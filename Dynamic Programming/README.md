<h2>Dynamic Programming</h2>
<p>Dynamic programming typically applies to optimization problems where we make a set of choices in order to arrive at an optimal solution. As we make choice at each step, a subproblem of same form (as the original) arises.</p>
<p> <h4>Basic steps in developing Dynamic Programming algorithm:</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>Characterize the structure of an optimal solution.</li>
		<li>Recursively define the value of an optimal solution.</li>
		<li>Compute the value of an optimal solution. </li>
		<li>Construct the steps to an optimal solution.</li>
	</ol>
